# hello-world
Learning Github
Learning to code through various online resources: Codecademy, FreeCodeCamp, SoloLearn, Coursera, etc.
I hope to work as a front end developer. So far I have learned HTML, CSS, Sass, jQuery, Javascript as well as learned to use API and JSON. Javascript coding is very challenging. There are many ways to write a piece of instruction in Javascript!
